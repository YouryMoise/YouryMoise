## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Youry Moise, and I'm a rising senior at MIT interested in Software Engineering and Embedded Systems. My experience includes leading the Firmware project and then Electrical subteam of MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team (SEVT), working as a Software Engineer Intern at Nasdaq, eBay, and PG&E, helping develop the NLP pipeline for MacLea, a tool designed to teach young kids about machine learning, and implementing the electrical system for the AttentivU project of MIT's Fluid Interfaces group. Outside of school and internships, I also enjoy working on personal coding projects. My goal is to work as a firmware/software engineer in the future. Feel free to visit my [personal website](https://yourymoise.github.io/personalwebsite) to learn more about my previous experience!
